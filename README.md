# SunSpec Integration for Sol-Ark Inverter

This document describes the SunSpec compliance implementation for the Sol-Ark inverter in the EMS-Dev platform.

## Overview

This implementation allows the EMS-Dev platform to act as a SunSpec-compliant Modbus TCP/IP server, exposing Sol-Ark inverter data in a standardized format that can be read by any SunSpec-compatible client.

The implementation follows the SunSpec Alliance specifications and includes:
- SunSpec Common Model (1) - Basic device information
- SunSpec Inverter Model (701) - AC Photovoltaic Inverter data
- SunSpec DER Storage Capacity Model (713) - Battery storage information

## Architecture

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. **SunSpec Models Definition** (`include/sunspec_models.h`): Defines the SunSpec model structure, register maps, and constants.

2. **SunSpec Mapper** (`src/sunspec_mapper.cpp`): Implements the mapping between Sol-Ark data and SunSpec registers.

3. **Modbus Client Integration** (`src/modbus_client.cpp`): Initializes the SunSpec models and updates the registers with Sol-Ark data.

## SunSpec Model Implementation

### Common Model (1)

The Common Model provides basic information about the device:
- Manufacturer: "Sol-Ark"
- Model: "Sol-Ark-12K-P" (Dynamically read from inverter if possible, otherwise this placeholder)
- Options: "None" (As per current implementation)
- Version: Dynamically read from Sol-Ark COMM_VERSION
- Serial Number: Dynamically read from Sol-Ark SN_BYTE parts

### Inverter Model (701) - AC Photovoltaic Inverter

The Inverter Model provides real-time data from the Sol-Ark inverter:
- AC measurements (current, voltage, power, frequency, energy, VA, VAR, PF)
- Operating state, status, and alarm information
- Grid connection status and DER operational characteristics
- Temperature (cabinet, transformer, IGBT)
- Per-phase AC measurements (L1, L2)

### DER Storage Capacity Model (713)

The DER Storage Capacity Model provides information about the connected battery storage:
- Energy Rating (Wh)
- Energy Available (Wh)
- State of Charge (SoC %)
- State of Health (SoH %) - Currently defaults to 100%
- Storage Status (OK, Warning, Error) - Based on BMS data

## Register Map

The SunSpec register map is implemented in the Modbus holding registers:

- Base address: 40000
- SunSpec ID marker ("SunS"): Registers 40000-40001
- Common Model (1): Starts at register 40002 (Offset 2 from base)
- Inverter Model (701): Starts at register 40070 (Offset 70 from base)
- DER Storage Capacity Model (713): Starts at register 40225 (Offset 225 from base)
- SunSpec End Block: Starts after the last model.

## Data Mapping

The implementation maps Sol-Ark data to SunSpec registers as follows:

### AC Measurements
- AC current: Average of inverter L1 and L2 currents
- AC voltage: Inverter voltage
- AC power: Inverter output power
- AC frequency: Inverter frequency
- AC energy: Load energy (converted from kWh to Wh)

### DC Measurements
- DC current: Battery current
- DC voltage: Battery voltage
- DC power: Battery power

### Temperature
- Cabinet temperature: Battery temperature

### Status
- Inverter status: Derived from inverter power
- Vendor-specific status: Grid connection, battery charging/discharging status (placed in Alarm Info field of Model 701)
- DER Mode: Grid Following/Forming based on grid relay status.
- AC Wiring Type: Dynamically set based on Sol-Ark Grid Type.

### DER Storage Capacity (Model 713)
- Energy Rating: Calculated from Sol-Ark battery capacity (Ah) and nominal voltage.
- Energy Available: Calculated from Energy Rating, SoC, and SoH.
- State of Charge (SoC): Uses Sol-Ark Battery SOC, overridden by BMS Real Time SOC if available.
- State of Health (SoH): Defaults to 100% as Sol-Ark does not directly provide this.
- Storage Status: Determined from Sol-Ark BMS Warning and Fault registers.

## Usage

The SunSpec-compliant Modbus TCP/IP server runs with the following settings:
- WiFi: Connects to an existing WiFi network
- IP Address: Dynamically assigned by DHCP (displayed on the OLED screen)
- TCP Port: 8502
- Protocol: Modbus TCP/IP

Any SunSpec-compatible Modbus TCP client can connect to this server to read the standardized inverter data.

## Testing

You can test the SunSpec implementation using:
1. SunSpec-compatible client software (e.g., SunSpec Dashboard)
2. Modbus TCP polling tools with the appropriate register map (e.g., ModbusPoll, QModMaster)
3. pysunspec2 library for Python-based testing (with TCP transport)
4. Example Python script in examples/sunspec_client_example.py (modified for TCP)

## Example TCP Client Connection

Using the pysunspec2 library:

```python
import sunspec2.modbus.client as client

# Connect to the SunSpec TCP server
c = client.SunSpecModbusClientTCP(host='192.168.1.x', port=8502)
c.connect()

# Read the models
c.scan()

# Access the inverter model
inv = c.models[701]

# Read inverter data
print(f"AC Power: {inv.points['W'].value} W")
print(f"AC Voltage: {inv.points['PhVphA'].value} V")
print(f"AC Frequency: {inv.points['Hz'].value} Hz")
print(f"DC Voltage: {inv.points['DCV'].value} V")
print(f"DC Current: {inv.points['DCA'].value} A")
print(f"Cabinet Temperature: {inv.points['TmpCab'].value} Â°C")

# Close the connection
c.close()
```
